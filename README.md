# Getting started with Tools Use on Cortex and Anthropic

## Overview
In this quickstart, you'll learn how to leverage Snowflake Cortex AI capabilities to create an intelligent weather assistant. This guide demonstrates how to implement AI tool use within Snowflake's ecosystem, allowing Cortex to access external data sources through API calls. You'll see how to define tools for AI models, execute tools when requested, and properly format tool results to create a complete tool use lifecycle.

The application showcases Snowflake's Cortex integration with Claude, enabling advanced conversational capabilities while maintaining Snowflake's security and governance. This implementation pattern illustrates how AI can be connected to real-world data sources within the Snowflake environment.
